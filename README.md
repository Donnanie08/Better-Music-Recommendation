# Better-Music-Recommendation
There are a lot of techniques for recommendation which use a collaborative or content based filtering methods. 
In this project we try to avoid the complexity of content based filtering method but achieve better results by using the play sequence of tracks to develop song-song similarities and then use it to regularize various matrix factorization methods for recommendation to improve recommendations.
